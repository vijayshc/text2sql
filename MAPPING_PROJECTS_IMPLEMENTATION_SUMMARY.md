### Architecture

#### Database Schema

**mapping_projects table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE mapping_projects (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

**mapping_documents table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE mapping_documents (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    project_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    uploaded_by INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES mapping_projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (uploaded_by) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
)
```

#### File Structure

**Backend:**
- `/src/models/mapping_project.py` - Project model with CRUD operations
- `/src/models/mapping_document.py` - Document model with file management
- `/src/routes/project_mapping_routes.py` - REST API endpoints
- `/src/utils/dataengineer.py` - Updated to accept project_name parameter

**Frontend:**
- `/templates/admin/mapping_projects.html` - UI template with DataTables
- `/static/js/admin/mapping-projects.js` - Frontend logic
- `/templates/agent_mode.html` - Project selector dropdown
- `/static/js/agent-chat.js` - Updated to pass project_name parameter

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/admin/mapping-projects` | Render mapping projects page |
| GET | `/api/mapping-projects` | List all projects |
| POST | `/api/mapping-projects` | Create new project |
| GET | `/api/mapping-projects/<id>` | Get project details |
| PUT | `/api/mapping-projects/<id>` | Update project |
| DELETE | `/api/mapping-projects/<id>` | Delete project |
| GET | `/api/mapping-projects/<id>/documents` | List documents in project |
| POST | `/api/mapping-projects/<id>/documents/upload` | Upload document |
| GET | `/api/mapping-projects/<id>/documents/<doc_id>/download` | Download document |
| DELETE | `/api/mapping-projects/<id>/documents/<doc_id>` | Delete document |

### User Interface

#### Mapping Projects Page (`/admin/mapping-projects`)

1. **Project Selection Modal**
   - DataTable with search/sort/pagination
   - Actions: Select, Edit, Delete
   - Create New Project button

2. **Main Page**
   - Current project info card
   - Drag-and-drop upload area
   - Documents DataTable with:
     - Filename
     - Uploaded by (username)
     - Uploaded at (timestamp)
     - Actions (Download, Delete)

#### Agent Mode Integration

- Project dropdown selector
- Auto-loads projects on page load
- Passes `project_name` parameter with agent requests
- Backward compatible (works without project selection)

### Testing Results

#### Database Tests ✅
```
✓ Project CRUD operations
✓ Document CRUD operations
✓ User tracking (uploaded_by)
✓ Foreign key constraints
✓ Cascade delete functionality
```

#### UI/UX Tests (Manual Testing Required)
- [ ] Create project via UI
- [ ] Upload Excel file to project
- [ ] Download document
- [ ] Delete document
- [ ] Update project details
- [ ] Delete project (verify documents deleted)
- [ ] DataTables search/sort/pagination
- [ ] Drag-and-drop file upload
- [ ] Alert notifications

#### Integration Tests (Manual Testing Required)
- [ ] Select project in agent mode
- [ ] Send query using get_mapping_details with project
- [ ] Verify correct mapping file is used
- [ ] Test without project selection (backward compatibility)
- [ ] End-to-end workflow: create → upload → use in agent → cleanup

### Key Features

1. **User Attribution**
   - Documents track which user uploaded them
   - Username displayed in documents table

2. **DataTables Integration**
   - Professional table display
   - Built-in search, sort, pagination
   - Responsive design

3. **File Management**
   - Secure filename handling
   - Automatic duplicate name resolution
   - Project-specific directory structure: `uploads/projects/<project_name>/`

4. **Agent Integration**
   - `dataengineer.py` resolves file path based on project_name
   - Falls back to default `src/utils/mapping.xlsx` if no project selected
   - Backward compatible with existing workflows

### Usage Instructions

#### For Administrators

1. **Create a Project**
   - Navigate to "Mapping Projects" in admin menu
   - Click "Select Project"
   - Click "Create New Project"
   - Enter project name and description
   - Save

2. **Upload Mapping Document**
   - Select a project
   - Drag and drop an Excel file OR click "Browse Files"
   - File is automatically uploaded and listed

3. **Manage Documents**
   - View all documents in DataTable
   - Download: Click download icon
   - Delete: Click trash icon, confirm deletion

#### For Agent Users

1. **Use Mapping in Agent Mode**
   - Go to Agent Mode
   - Select project from dropdown (optional)
   - Use tools like `get_mapping_details`
   - If project selected: uses project's mapping file
   - If no project: uses default mapping file

### Error Handling

- Invalid file types rejected (only .xlsx, .xls allowed)
- Duplicate filenames auto-renamed with counter
- Foreign key violations prevented by cascade delete
- User-friendly error messages via Bootstrap alerts
- DataTable reinitialization properly handled

### Security Considerations

- `login_required` decorator on all endpoints
- `secure_filename` used for file uploads
- File path validation prevents directory traversal
- Foreign key constraints maintain data integrity

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Version control for mapping documents
2. Document comparison/diff functionality
3. Bulk document operations
4. Project templates
5. Document validation upon upload
6. Project sharing/collaboration features
7. Audit trail for document changes
8. Excel file preview in browser
